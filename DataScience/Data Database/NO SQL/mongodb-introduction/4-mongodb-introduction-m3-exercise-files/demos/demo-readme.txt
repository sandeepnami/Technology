NOTE:
These files are intended to augment the videos in this module by providing a series of
interactive experiments you can perform.  The "before" file provides some starter data,
and then presents a series of suggested experiments.  The "after" file demonstrates a
solution to each exercise.

1) Go to www.mongodb.org and download mongo.

2) Unpack mongo executables to a directory (c:\mongo for example).

3) Open a command prompt and change directory to where you unpacked mongo.

4) Create a data directory for this excercise (c:\mongo\data for example).

5) Start the mongo server (assuming your data directory is c:\mongo\data):
	c:\mongo> start mongod --dbpath c:\mongo\data

6) Enter the mongo shell
	c:\mongo> mongo
