// 1: Change to a 'demo' database


// 2: Create an empty document with _id =1 in the collection foo. Show the document.


// 3: Add a field 'n' to the document you just created, and assign it a value of 12. Show the document.


// 4: Add 4 to field n who's value is less than 16. Run this update multiple times. Show the document.
// Subsequent updates should not affect the document once n has reached 16.


// 5: Add an array field named 'tags' to your document. Add 'a' to it. Show the document.


// 6: Add 'b' and 'c' to the tags array, but ensure that running the command 
// multiple times does not add 'b' or 'c' more than once. Try doing it in 2 different ways


// 7: Add 9 more documents with ids ranging from 2 to 10. You can use a javascript for-loop for this.


// 8: Add a field named 'early' to all documents with id less than or equal 5. Set the field value to boolean true.
// Hint: You will need to update multiple records at once.


// 9: Remove the array on the document  with id 1 using findAndModify(). Return the modified document (the result of your modification).
