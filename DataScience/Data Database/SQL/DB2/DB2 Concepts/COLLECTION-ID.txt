B)COLLECTION ID:
--------------
The collection_id is a qualifier that denotes a logical grouping of packages. When binding a package, you must always specify the collection_id 

BIND PACKAGE (COL1)    BIND PACKAGE (COL1)   BIND PACKAGE (COL2)
MEMBER (PROGA) ...     MEMBER (PROGB) ...    MEMBER (PROGB)...

C)PACKAGE ID:

c)Package_id

The package_id is a qualifier that is automatically generated from the name of the DBRM input at bind package time.
