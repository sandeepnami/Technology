PRIMARY KEY

Whenever you define a PRIMARY or UNIQUE key on a column, DB2 creates a unique index to enforce uniqueness on the column

------------------------------------------
What are indexes?
An index is an ordered list of the key values of a column or columns of a table. 
There are two reasons why you might create an index:

· To ensure uniqueness of values in a column or columns.
· To improve performance of queries against the table. The DB2 optimizer will use indexes to improve performance when performing queries, or to present results of a query in the order of the index.

Indexes can be defined as unique or nonunique. 
Nonunique indexes allow duplicate key values; 
Unique indexes allow only one occurrence of a key value in the list.
