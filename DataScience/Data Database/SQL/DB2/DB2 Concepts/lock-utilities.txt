---------------------------
Two important features of DB2 are DB2I (DB2INTERACTIVE)
and EXPLAIN.

TSO supports both batch and online DB2 applications.
TSO batch applications execute under the TSO monitor
program directly. TSO online applications execute under the 
control of Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF), which is a screen/dialog manager for TSO. DB2I intself is a 
TSO online application.
 

DB2I:(Program Preparation, DB2 commands, Execute the SQL(SPUFI),Bind the PACKAGE and PLAN).

1) Logon to TSO and enter to ISPF.
2) Select DB2I option or type =D on the command line

----------------------------------------------------
         DB2I PRIMARY OPTION MENU

===>_

Select one of the following options and press ENTER.

1.SPUFI
2.DCLGEN
3.PROGRARM PREPARATION
4.PRECOMPILE
5.BIND/REBIND/FREE
6.RUN
7.DB2 COMMANDS
8.UTILITIES.

X EXIT

----------------------------------------------------

1) SPUFI: This supports online execution of SQL statements
from TSO terminal.
SPUFI - We can store the results of the querry in the dataset.
Can run multiple querries..

2)DCLGEN (Declaration Generator): This a program that creates
COBOL structure declarations from table desriptions in the
catalog. The output from DCLGEN is stored as a member of a
partitioned data set.It can be copied into an application
program by means of a embedded SQL INCLUDE statement.

---------------------------------------------------------
QMF: Query Management Facility.
Type =Q on the command line
QMF main menu would be displayed.
press PF6 to type the Query
Type the querry and Press PF2 to run.
If there are any errors, It will show on the screen or
else the output will be displayed on the same screen.
It also has REPORT utility for formatting.

Disadvantages: Only one QUERRY can executed.
we cannot save the output into a file as we do in SPUFI.
---------------------------------------------------------
EXPLAIN:
Explain allows the user to obtain the information regarding
the optimizer's choice of strategy fora specified SQL statement. The information provided includes:
- indexes used
- details of any sorts that will be needed.
- if the specified statement involves JOIN, then the order
  in which the tables will be joined, and the methods by which
  the individual joins are performed.

The syntax for EXPLAIN:

EXPLAIN type FOR statement;

Here "type" is a PLAN.

EXPLAIN PLAN FOR 
        SELECT S.S#, P.P#
        FROM S, P
        WHERE S.CITY = P.CITY;

When is EXPLAIN is executed, DB2 will place the information
regarding its implementation of the specified SELECT statment
into PLAN_TABLE.
(xyz.PLAN_TABLE which must already exist - XYZ is the authorization id)

------------------------------------------------------------
DATABASE UTILITIES:

CHECK DATA:  This utility can be used to check a table space
to seeif there are any referential integrity violations.

CHECK INDEX: This utility can be used to test whether indexes
are consistent with the data they index.

COPY: This utility creates a full or incremental backup copies of a table space or partition.

LOAD: This utility loads data from a sequential data set into
one or more talbes within one or more partitions of a specified
table space.

RECOVER: This utility uses the most recent full copy, any
subsequent incremental copies, and any subsequent log data
to recover one or more table spaces, partitions or pages.

REORG: This utility reorganizes a table spaces or index space
to reclaim wasted spaces to reestablish the clustering sequence.

RUNSTATS: This utility computes statistics on specified
stored data (eg. sepecified table space etc)

DIAGNOSE: This utility is used to aid in determining and correcting system problems. For eg, It can be used to take a dump of the system when error conditions occur.

------------------------------------------------------------
LOCKING:
TRANSACTION is a logical unit of work.
The transaction can end with a COMMIT or ROLLBACK.
see the day wise ppt..

COMMIT: This operation signals successful end-of-transaction.
changes has to be committed or made permanent.

ROLLBACK: This operation signals unsuccessful end-of-transaction. Changes has to be rolled back or undone.

DB2 resolves the concurrency problems by means of LOCKING:
The effect of lock is to lock the other transactions out of
the object, and thereby preventing them from changing it.

LOCKING FACILITIES IN DB2:
Locks can be acquried by one of the methods given below:

a) The SQL statement LOCK TABLE.
b) The ISOLATION parameter on the BIND PACKAGE command.
c) The table space LOCKSIZE parameter.
d) ACQURE/RELEASE parameters on the BIND PLAN command.

a) SQL statement:

SYNTAX:

LOCK TABLE table IN mode MODE;

EG,

LOCK TABLE EMPLOYEE IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;

b) ISOLATION parameter (CS,RR,RS,UR)

c) LOCKSIZE (PAGE,TABLE, TABLESPACE, OR ANY)

d) ACQUIRE or RELEASE (See the JCL)

-------------------------------------------------------------

DCL:
See the daywise ppt.

-------------------------------------------------------------
SYNONYMS AND ALIAS:

ALIAS is an alternate name for a base table.

a) CREATE TABLE EMP;
This table is created by USER1.

b) Another user USER2 can refer to this EMP table by
SELECT * 
FROM UESER1.EMP;

C)Alternatively USER2 can issue:
CREATE ALIAS ABC FOR USER1.EMP;

d)NOw USER2 can refer to the USER1's table by
SELECT *
FROM ABC;

e)Another user USER3 can also use user USER2's alias ABC to
refer to base table.

SELECT *
FROM USER2.ABC

f) Drop Alias
DROP ALIAS ABC

g) DROP TABLE EMP
(Dropping table (Base table) causes all aliases for that
table to be dropped automatically).

-------------------------------------------------------
SYNONYM like alias is an alternative name for a table.

1) Synonym is private to the user who creates it.
2) synonym cannot refer to the remote table ( Distributed
database support)

same commands as alias.....
