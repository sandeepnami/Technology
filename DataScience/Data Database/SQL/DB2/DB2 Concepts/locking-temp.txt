DB2 resolves the concurrency problems by means of LOCKING:
The effect of lock is to lock the other transactions out of
the object, and thereby preventing them from changing it.

LOCKING FACILITIES IN DB2:
Locks can be acquried by one of the methods given below:

a) The SQL statement LOCK TABLE.
b) The ISOLATION parameter on the BIND PACKAGE command.
c) The table space LOCKSIZE parameter.
d) ACQURE/RELEASE parameters on the BIND PLAN command.

a) SQL statement:

LOCK TABLE table IN mode MODE;

EG,

LOCK TABLE EMPLOYEE IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;

b) ISOLATION parameter (CS,RR,RS,UR)

c) LOCKSIZE (PAGE,TABLE, TABLESPACE, OR ANY)
