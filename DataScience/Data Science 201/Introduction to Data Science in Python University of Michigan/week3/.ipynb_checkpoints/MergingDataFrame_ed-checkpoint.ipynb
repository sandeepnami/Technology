The circle on the right is the population of staff at a university. And the overlapping region in the middle are all of those students who are also staff.  Maybe these students run tutorials for a course, or grade assignments, or engage in running research experiments.\n",

A solid understanding of how to merge data is absolutely essentially when you are procuring, cleaning, and manipulating data.
