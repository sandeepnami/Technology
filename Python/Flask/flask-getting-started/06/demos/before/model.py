model.py
--------
Implements the model for our website by simulating a database.

Note: although this is nice as a simple example, don't do this in a real-world
production setting. Having a global object for application data is asking for
trouble. Instead, use a real database layer, like
https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/.
