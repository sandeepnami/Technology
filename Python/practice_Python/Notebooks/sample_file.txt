I dedicate this book to Nancy Lier Cosgrove Mullis.
Jean-Paul Sartre somewhere observed that we each of us make our own hell out of the people around u
s. Had Jean-Paul known Nancy, he may have noted that at least one man, someday, might get very lucky,
and make his own heaven out of one of the people around him. She will be his morning and his evening
star, shining with the brightest and the softest light in his heaven. She will be the end of his wanderings,
and their love will arouse the daffodils in the spring to follow the crocuses and precede the irises. Their f
aith in one another will be deeper than time and their eternal spirit will be seamless once again.
Or maybe he would have just said, “If I’d had a woman like that, my books would not have been about d
espair.”
This book is not about despair. It is about a little bit of a lot of things, and, if not a single one of them is
wet with sadness, it is not due to my lack of depth; it is due to a year of Nancy, and the prospect of neve
r again being without her.
